questions I'd like to answer in reporting once I have full database:
- what bidding strategy / timing works best? bidding one single time at 2mins out? 10 seconds out? is there a difference on average at all?
    - need to analyze full population's bid history
- lets get a report on 2 minute nightmare. does he live up to the name?
- can we identify people as "quick bid button pushers".
    - how often do they do it? when?
    - I'd like to see a breakdown of quick bid spam bids by dimensions
- can I analyze the bid history to determine certain scenarios?
    - someone gave their max amount, was outbid, then later upped it to try to win
        - then, how far above their original max amount did they end up paying?
- can I identify a re-listed item? I know they have to be re-listing items that don't sell
	- would lot number stay the same?
	- would love to see the most re-listed item(s)
	- what items do not sell but are not re-listed?

stuff to do with reporting stuff:
- users reporting table
    - how many times did user extend bidding? - would be useful for 2min nightmare look
- add to view
    - total bid (different than "total spent - bid". this is total $ amount of all bids placed)

new tabs
- SC affiliate summary
    - stats
        --- total sales
        --- total users (people that placed a bid)
        - best selling auction
        --- most expensive item
        --- total items sold
        --- total bids recieved
        --- total images uploaded
        - profit per item sold
        - profit per item uploaded (to give a payoff / effort ratio over time)
        --- most frequent category
        - total made in auction fees
        - total taxes collected
        --- items sold
        --- auctions posted
        - avg revenue per item sold
    - over-time views
        - many / all of the stats but over time (like in the user lookup dash)
        - # of times category was posted each month (with a line color for each category type)
        - NEW users (how many new users gained each month?)
    - item view
        - want to see most expensive item (be able to sort by price)
    - category view
- affiliate analysis
    - where are we wasting effort?
        - revenue per image uploaded analysis
        - revenue per item listed, by category, sorted from worst to best
        - analysis of unsold items (by cat? by some other dimension?)
    - where are we getting the most value?
        - revenue per item listed, by category, sorted from best to worst

thought dump on determining optimal time to bid:

- definitively, less than 5 mins
- maybe just before 2 mins?
    - let's go with this for now
- I feel that if we bid at say 15 seconds, then the person that was 'winning' it from 2 mins to 15 secs would feel in their heart like it was theirs.
    You get that spike at < 30 secs where it's like "oh nobody is going to snipe this at this point, this is mine"
    I feel bidding past that point would lead to us getting outbid by people that are now suddenly more attached to the item
- however maybe if someone is going to outbid to win it, they are going to anyway
- maybe there are several kinds of bidders. lets list a few we can think of, and then determine how we can out-bid each
    - bidder that bids way ahead of time and leaves it
        - this kind of bidder loses most of the time
        - doing this just sets the table for the "oo what's it going for" kind of bidder, and ultimately just gets serge more money
    - bidder that puts in their max bid 5 mins out
    - bidders that are not firm on their max bid and keep inching it up
        - bidder that is emotionally attached to their item
            they've thought about where they want to put it in their house and pictured it there
            they started thinking about this when the price was at $1.25 and that thought was just part of their decision making process,
            but now it's night-of, and it's at $7, and they've been picturing holding it in their hands for a while...
            I am unsure what pattern of bidding this would result in. possibly a "keeps increasing max bid" pattern.
        - bidders with simply no self control and want to win for the high of it. impulsive people.
            "oh just $0.25 more and I could see the Green Message(tm)"
            this bidder says the word 'win' a lot. probably also likes mac bid
    - bidders that ask "oo what's it going for" before determining their max price
        - they have trouble coming up with an appropriate price for the item and want to take in the current high bid to influence their decision
        - if I told the bidder that the current price was $1, they'd say 'max $3'. if I had said it was $4, they'd have said $6.

bidding notes

https://www.bidrl.com/auction/personal-care-health-beauty-auction-161-johns-rd-unit-a-south-carolina-april-24-152767/item/one-two-lash-magnetic-lashes-factory-sealed-19776588/


when submitting a bid on the above url with a bid of $1.50, and accepting the terms at the same time, I got the following in Network inspect element:

bid
    https://www.bidrl.com/api/auctions/152767/items/19776588/bid
    POST

    payload:
        bid: 1.5
        accept_terms: 1
        buyer_number: 
        shipping_method: pickup

auctionterms
    https://www.bidrl.com/api/auctionterms
    POST

    payload:
        id: 152767


I then submitted a bid after already having accepted the terms on an earlier item, and I got the same exact result

I tried to submit a bid without accepting the terms and got blocked on client side. no network activity present

I'm wondering if I can just submit the bid straight up with "accept_terms: 1" in the payload, or if I need to POST auctionterms first

update 4.25.24:
this turned out to be true! no auctionterms POST needed. only need to POST bid with "bid" and "accept_terms" pieces in payload
